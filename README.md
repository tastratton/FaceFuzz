# FaceFuzz - simple template rendering

FaceFuzz generates content from text templates.

FaceFuzz is *not* a fully grown [mustache](https://github.com/mustache/spec)

## Goals

- *Minimal* template language features in core
- Ahead Of Time (AOT) Compile / Trim compatibility
- Simplicity
- Safety
- Additional template language features should be plugins, to allow feature opt in based on needs.  
  This may allow FaceFuzz to optionally support full mustache features.
